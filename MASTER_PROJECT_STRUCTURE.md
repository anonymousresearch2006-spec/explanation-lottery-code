# Project Structure — Explanation Lottery Repository

## Overview

This document describes the repository organization and execution flow for the **Explanation Lottery** project. The structure is designed to ensure:

* full experimental reproducibility
* modular research development
* clear separation of data, computation, and outputs
* easy navigation for reviewers and researchers

The repository follows a simple **4-folder architecture**.

## Repository Layout

```

├── scripts/          # Experimental pipeline and research code
├── data/             # Dataset retrieval utilities (no raw data stored)
├── results/          # Generated outputs and publication findings
├── docs/             # Technical documentation
├── reproduce.py      # Main execution entry point
└── requirements.txt  # Environment specification
```

## Directory Description

### `/scripts/` — Research Engine

Contains all executable research code organized by development phase.

* **01_foundations/** — Initial discovery experiments identifying explanation disagreement.
* **02_extension/** — Scaled experiments and cross-dataset analysis.
* **03_rigor_and_proofs/** — Statistical validation and theoretical analysis.
* **04_official_roadmap/** — Core optimized experiments used to generate manuscript results.
* **05_infrastructure/** — Execution utilities and orchestration tools.

This directory implements the full experimental pipeline.

---

### `/data/` — Dataset Management

Manages all input datasets required for experiments.

* Datasets are automatically downloaded from OpenML.
* Raw datasets are not stored in the repository.
* Data is prepared using `data/download_data.py`.

This ensures reproducible and lightweight data handling.

---

### `/results/` — Experimental Outputs

Stores outputs generated by the experimental pipeline.

* **00_publication_findings/** — Final aggregated results used in the paper.
* **01_visualizations/** — Publication-ready figures.

All intermediate outputs are generated automatically and excluded from version control.

---

### `/docs/` — Technical Documentation

Contains supporting documentation for understanding and reproducing the project.

* **run_guide.md** — Execution and environment setup instructions.
* **method_overview.md** — Experimental methodology.
* **project_structure.md** — Repository organization (this document).
* **paper_code_mapping.md** — Mapping between manuscript results and scripts.

---

## Execution Flow

The complete workflow follows these steps:

1. Install dependencies.
2. Download datasets.
3. Execute the reproducibility pipeline.
4. Generate results and visualizations.

Run the full pipeline using:

```
python reproduce.py
```

---

## Reproducibility Design

The repository is structured so that any researcher can:

* recreate the experimental environment,
* execute the full pipeline,
* regenerate all reported findings,
* inspect intermediate results.

All components are organized to support transparent and verifiable scientific experimentation.
